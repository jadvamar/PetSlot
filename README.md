# PetSlot
Pet Slot is an online platform where pet service shops can register and offer their services to pet owners. Users can search for nearby shops based on location, book available slots, and view the shop’s details, including services, location on the map, and reviews. Pet service shops can manage bookings, mark services as completed, and interact with users through reviews.

## Features
Shop Registration and Service Management

Pet service shops can register on the platform and list their services for pet care (e.g., grooming, training, boarding, etc.).
Shop owners can manage their available services, update pricing, and manage working hours.
User Search for Shops Based on Location

Users can search for pet service shops based on their location.
The platform uses a map integration to store and display shop locations accurately.
The map provides users with a visual representation of nearby shops.
Booking Available Slots

After selecting a shop, users can choose the desired date for a service.
Available time slots for the chosen date are displayed, and users can select an available slot for booking.
Slot availability is updated in real-time to prevent double bookings.
JWT Authentication for Secure Access

JWT (JSON Web Tokens) is used to secure and authenticate both users and shop owners.
This ensures secure login and protects sensitive user information during bookings, reviews, and other interactions.
Service Completion and History

After a service is completed, the shop owner can mark the service as “done” in the system.
Once marked, the completed service will reflect in the user’s booking history, providing them with an overview of past services.
Review System

After a service is completed, users can leave reviews for the shop.
Reviews help other users make informed decisions when selecting shops.
Reviews can include ratings and comments based on the user's experience.
Shop Profile with Detailed Information

Each shop has a dedicated page where users can view important information like:
Photos of the shop and its facilities
Services offered with detailed descriptions and pricing
Location displayed on an interactive map for easy navigation
